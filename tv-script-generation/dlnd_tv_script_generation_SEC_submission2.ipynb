      "\"First off, I do not believe that Iran *should* have nuclear weapons. In fact, I believe Iran having nuclear weapons makes the world less safe overall. However, I believe that as a sovereign nation they have the right to develop nuclear weapons if they so choose.  Why do I believe this:  1. It is in Iran's best strategic interests to develop nuclear weapons in order to counter Israel (which has nuclear weapons), and additionally to one-up Saudi Arabia (their main regional rival), and guarantee their safety against other Arab nations with whom they have historically had rocky relations (Iraq, for example). 2. If Israel can illegally possess nuclear weapons (they haven't officially acknowledge they have nuclear weapons, nor have they signed the UN's non-proliferation treaty, making the weapons they do possess illegal), why can't Iran possess nuclear weapons, other than Western bias? Pakistan has nuclear weapons, and they are officially an Islamic Republic, and they can have nuclear weapons, even though their nuclear weapons are probably much more of a global security risk.   3. Iran has proven itself to be a pragmatic and rational actor in world affairs. There is no reason to suspect that they would actually use a nuclear weapon, nor sell it to a terrorist group who would. They mainly want a nuclear weapon to secure their military position in the region, stick it to their rivals, and as a point of national pride. Because the West says Iran can't have a nuclear weapon, they want one all the more, and won't back down on that because of national pride, something an American should be able to sympathize with.   Now, I recognize that Iran should not have nuclear weapons because it would cause an arms race in the most volatile region on Earth, but that doesn't mean that they, as a sovereign nation, do not have the right to develop a nuclear weapon.  \"\n",

      "\"It seems to me that it is entirely justified to believe that a set of beliefs are wrong and to desire to see less people follow that belief. If you disagree with certain parts of a religion and believe that following them to the letter is a terrible thing to do that seems a very reasonable belief, especially considering certain religious practices. However, I would say that is not ok to bear animosity towards someone simply because they identify as a part of a certain religion. If they act in a harmful way because of their religion it is ok to hate them, but if they simply identify or agree with it but do not actually conduct any actions you believe to be wrong, than it is not ok to hold any grudge against them.

      "\"The, \"\"Under God\"\" line is actually a relatively new addition. It was added during the Cold War to assert the US from the Soviet Union. Now that the Soviet Union is not currently around this would seem all the more useless. The USA is not any one religion, this country is a collection of many different religions as well as the lack of religion thereof. We are not a Christian nation or even a monotheistic nation. In my view, the line shows favor towards Monotheism.   It may be more appropriate to add a more fitting line. \"\n",
      "\"I drink a lot of diet soda.  Like... six to twelve cans per day.  I rarely drink any regular soda with calories.  In fact, I grew up with diet soda and I tend to prefer the diet soda taste to regular soda.  Because of my amount of intake, I've spent a lot of time researching all of the facets of the issue, and I've found that the studies which condemn diet soda and/or aspartame are few and far between.  This is in direct contrast to all of the literature condemning diet soda and aspartame which is *not* scholarly.  In essence, the studies tend to say it's fine and the blogs tend to say it's not.  I put infinitely more faith in scientific rigor.  Aspartame is one of the most-studied compounds on the planet, and dozens (hundreds?) of nations have given it the okay.  There is likely a correlation between obesity and diet soda drinkers, however I think it's pretty obvious that causality is mixed up, here.  I think that 1) people who are obese are more likely to drink diet soda as a \"\"diet\"\", and 2) people tend to order a diet soda along with a bunch of fast food or otherwise unhealthy food.  It's about the lifestyle which some live, not the diet soda itself.  I'm not interested in lifestyle, just the diet soda itself.  Some say that it ruins your teeth, but in the studies I've read they were testing people who already had poor oral hygiene.  I think that pretty much gives it away right there.  Additionally, I may only be a sample size of one, but I've had a lot of diet soda every day for years now, and I haven't had a cavity since before puberty.  Again, it's anecdotal, but it's something.  Please give me an argument, not just a link to a study.  I've read studies linked with regards to this topic before, and there is almost always some flaw, such as a diet soda drinker who already had poor oral hygiene, the drinker already being obese, or the behavior only being shown in rats.  **I'd like something that says that otherwise healthy people become unhealthy solely because of diet soda and/or aspartame, not the lifestyle which surrounds it.**  Thanks! \"\n",
      "\"My wife has recently gotten deeply involved/obsessed with the healing properties of essential oils.  I am cursed with a common problem in that I am an extremely skeptical person.  I can't help but look at this product and see a pyramid scheme that takes advantage of the gullible.  All the shit my wife watches on these oils is carefully worded to make sure they don't make actual healing claims, I'm told this is because they aren't FDA approved and could get in trouble.  I've looked a little and haven't found anything debunking these oils but i still cannot help but feel they are total BS.  I would love to get more information from unbiased sources on this.

      "\"Thinking about today's news: [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-30710777), [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Hebdo_shooting)  I think France is in a tough spot in how to react to this. There would be even stronger calls for an anti-islam and anti-immigration policies. These event reminds people that they cannot depend on protection by government. I think it would be a shame to allow the many, who are afraid more then anything, to be swayed by xenophobic nationalists (which might have been the goal of the attack anyway).   I think this, regardless of whether the weapons used by the attackers were owned legally, makes a good case for promoting a culture of a reasonable gun ownership and carrying. Say if 1 out of 5 people carried a gun with them, was well trained in its use and tested in his responsibility to prevent its misuse, and society upheld the value of these people as protectors, it would benefit the society more the the current state of legislature and culture of gun ownership in most of European countries. I also think this would be much better then increase in police numbers and rights as policemen are a very homogeneous group trained to stick together and the danger of even deepening the \"\"not one of us\"\" (pack) mentality and escalation of \"\"police state\"\". Change my view.  PS: I am not here to talk about USA and its gun problems.  EDIT: Awarded a delta to a comment which didn't refute this idea but led me to change my view that it would be best realized with paralyzing weapons rather then guns: http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2rnr30/cmv_i_think_the_paris_shooting_makes_a_good_case/cni3o83 \"\n",
      "\"Context: the [tragedy at Charlie Hebdo](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30710883) on 1/7/15. Whether this attack was directly provoked by a printed image of Muhammad or not, my argument will be framed as if it were. I'll paraphrase some of my posts in other threads:  The problem I have with this is that non-Muslims came out of the blue to offend Muslims on this particular issue. There's no honor in that, we're not on any sort of moral high ground.  Consider this hypothetical: Previously, there was no issue with freedom of expression. Then Some Guy learns that many Muslims forbid printed images of their prophet. Guy says, \"\"hey, wouldn't it be *just hilarious* if we *printed an image of their prophet*??\"\" So Guy prints image of their prophet. Angry terrorist coward shoots and kills Guy. Guy's friends call him a martyr, cry censorship. Except there is no censorship, freedom of expression still exists 100%, Guy's publication and others can and likely will post more of these images in the future.   If a group of people is encroaching upon your rights or beliefs then by all means defend yourself as appropriate. And as I understand it, many Muslim factions are indeed doing that around Europe and there is no insignificant amount of tension. But in this particular instance, *we kindof started it.* We created an issue where there was none.  Freedom of expression does not imply freedom from consequences. SHOULD murder be the consequence? *Absolutely not.* However, what *should be* in this world and *what are* are two completely different things; so, we fight battles to turn the \"\"what ares\"\" into the \"\"should bes.\"\" Is the battle to print images of Muhammad, among human trafficking and rape and all the other issues, really one we need to be fighting, really worth losing lives over? I guess for some, maybe. I wonder how that policeman and his family feel about it.   So now, we created a situation where 1) we defend freedom of speech at high cost and continue to print things like this, or 2) we censor ourselves and the turrists win. It's a situation born of childishness that has now ended in tragedy and left us with a difficult path forward. The \"\"point\"\" that now exists to be made did not exist before our initial and unprovoked challenge to Muslim beliefs. And in the name of what, *satire*?    **EDIT: I appreciate all the responses, a handful of you have given some great discussion. However I'm getting mired and confused in trying to keep up with and remain thoughtful in my responses, so I am taking a break to reflect and collect. I will come back and answer those I have missed. Thanks again, back in a little while.** \"\n",
      "\"As an independent form of study, philosophy doesn't seem to have any practical applications. What value does philosophy have in the modern age, right now, aside from contemplating things. Is it truly worth it to invest a significant amount of time and money studying this field?   There do not seem to be any tangible applications or appreciable benefits from studying philosophy aside from personal growth and the expansion of one's intellectual perspective, which I argue can be gained without studying philosophy in a rigorously academic manner.    I often have read the argument that it is impossible to argue that philosophy is useless without using philosophy, or something along those lines.  I acknowledge this. Yes, I am engaging in the use of philosophy right now, at this very moment. However, this does not provide an argument as to why it would be worthwhile to STUDY philosophy.   What do you gain from studying philosophy that could not be gained from thoughtful introspection?   Certainly, important tools have originated from philosophical study, such as the scientific method, and science could be described as a subset of philosophy itself but that isn't an argument against the lack of tangible benefits to be gained from studying philosophy.  You don't need to study philosophy to become a capable scientist. You shouldn't need to study philosophy to cultivate a reasonable set of moral principles, or to be thoughtful about the circumstances and situations you encounter in your life.
